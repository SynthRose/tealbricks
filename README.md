# Teal Bricks
*For Minecraft 20w12a*

This mod adds Teal Nether Bricks and associated slabs, stairs, and walls to Minecraft. They are crafted just like Red Nether Bricks, but using Nether Sprouts instead of Nether Wart. Also, Warped Wart Blocks can now be crafted using 9 Nether Sprouts, and have been renamed to Nether Sprout Blocks to better mirror Nether Wart Blocks (which aren't called Crimson Wart Blocks). Nether Sprouts have also been given an item model.

That was supposed to be it, but then I ended up adding Lantern Blocks too. There are both regular and soul fire versions. They're crafted with four iron ingots around a lantern.

You'll need [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) to use this mod. Feel free to put it in your packs. Enjoy.
